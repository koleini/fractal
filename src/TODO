TODO:

0.5. first vm definition!
1. application number is hardcoded!
1. Jitsu assumes one interface per vm
2. When DNS query arrives, no error arises if name is not defined
3. what happens when the original vm is shutdown?
4. What happens if we have already shutdown vms? We can reuse them instead of defining new vms, or delete sgutdown replicas (second loosk better)
5. openvswitch controller port is not that reliable. Sometimes it is not possible for the script to connect, and just waits. Restarting openvswitch sevice helps
